## Editor's note

The song "Saludo Muysca," which translates as "Muisca Greetings," is part of corpus of songs composed by some of the members of the indigenous Cabildo Muisca of Suba as part of the first two readers of Muisca language produced by them. The lyrics of the songs are composed in Spanish and Muysc cubun, the Muisca language, as they are not current native speakers of the language. The lyrics introduce children to Muysc cubun vocabulary ( colors, names of animals, etc), and other pieces of vocabulary so that they can start learning the language in didactic ways.  

The song "Saludo Muysca" is particularly salient as it was specially composed to introduce members of the community to a form of salutation found in colonial sources that they are attempting to use again.

For more information on the colonial entry, please see the Spanish- Muys cubun dictionary that contains the digital copy and transcription of the colonial linguistic source [Salutation and resalutation colonial Muysccubun](http://coleccionmutis.cubun.org/Manuscrito_2922_BPRM/Vocabulario/fol_22r).

The first version of the song contains lyrics in Muysc cubun and Spanish. The second version includes lyrics in Muysc cubun and the English translation.





The corpus of songs collected here is particularly revealing of the current Muisca language revitalization strategies.
